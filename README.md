# TriviaGame

This is a Javascript / jQuery based trivia game. 

A timer starts at 30 and begins counting down upon navigating to the page.
There are 8 questions total, with 4 options for each answer.
The user can select only one answer per question.

When the user is finished, or the timer reaches 0, the player will be alerted that the time is up and
will be directed to the results page where the number of both correct and incorrect answers will be displayed.
